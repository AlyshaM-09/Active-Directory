Microsoft Active Directory (AD) is a directory service designed to simplify network management for organizations. Operating on Windows Server, AD efficiently stores and organizes information about network components, including users, devices, and services. It provides convenient access to this information for both administrators and users. Furthermore, AD allows administrators to regulate permissions, manage access to network resources, and create security policies, thus optimizing the overall network management process. <br>
